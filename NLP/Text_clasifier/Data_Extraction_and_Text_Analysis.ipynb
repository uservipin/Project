      "1997 Highlights -- During 1997, the Company completed its restructuring program\n",
      "and initiated a growth strategy that has generated consistent quarterly double\n",
      "digit sales growth throughout the year. The company exited all its non-core\n",
      "businesses in 1997, closed 18 factories, 43 warehouses and 5 headquarters,\n",
      "reduced employment by approximately 50% (half of which reflects reductions\n",
      "related to the disposition of non-core businesses) and substantially reduced its\n",
      "SKU offerings as part of its restructuring program. Concurrent with the\n",
      "restructuring program, the Company also implemented a three year growth plan to\n",
      "strengthen the Sunbeam(R) and Oster(R) brand names and expand distribution\n",
      "globally. Albert J. Dunlap, Sunbeam's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said\n",
      "\"I am very proud of the dramatic turnaround that we have achieved at Sunbeam in\n",
      "such a short period of time as we continue to execute against our three year\n",
      "growth plans. Our continu ous sales increases of 13%, 17%, 28% and 31% in the\n",
      "four quarters of 1997, for an overall sales increase of 22% for the year, are a\n",
      "clear indication that our strategy is working.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company's three year strategy to achieve $1 billion in revenue growth, which\n",
      "it embarked upon in 1997, was fueled by the addition of 25 international\n",
      "distribution/license agreements, the introduction of 35 new U.S. products and 54\n",
      "new international products along with the contribu tion from 22 factory outlet\n",
      "stores. \"We experienced sales growth in all major channels of distri bution, in\n",
      "all regions of the world and in each of our five global businesses, and we\n",
      "gained market share in all of our key product categories, reversing a three year\n",
      "downward trend, \" said Mr. Dunlap. Sales to the Company's top 10 retailers were\n",
      "up 15% and 22% in the latest quarter and\n",
      "     <page>\n",
      "      full year, respectively. International sales which are projected to contribute\n",
      "40% of the Company's three year growth goal, were up 42%, and 34% for the\n",
      "quarter and full year, respectively. Leading the sales growth internationally\n",
      "was the Asia/Pacific region, up 425%, and the Latin American region, up 32%.\n",
      "\"The primary catalyst for this growth has been our ability to improve customer\n",
      "service levels and introduce innovative and differentiated new products at an\n",
      "accelerated pace. As part of the restructuring we implemented a new product\n",
      "development process that has enabled us to reduce new product development time\n",
      "from over 2 years to approximately 6 months,\" said Mr. Dunlap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Equally as important as our strong top line growth was the remarkable\n",
      "improvement in operating margins, year over year, and the continuous margin\n",
      "expansion we delivered through-out the year. We set a three year goal to have\n",
      "20% operating margins, and we were essentially at that level in the 3rd and 4th\n",
      "quarters this year,\" said Mr. Dunlap. The Company's operating margins of 20% in\n",
      "the 4th quarter and 17% for the full year reflect the numerous initiatives\n",
